# c-libp2p

**c-libp2p** is an implementation of the [libp2p specification](https://github.com/libp2p/specs) written in C.  The project is still in active development but already provides the building blocks needed for peer-to-peer networking applications.

## Building

c-libp2p uses CMake and should build on Linux, macOS and Windows.  A C compiler that supports the C11 standard is required.

### Clone the repository

```sh
git clone --recursive https://github.com/Pier-Two/c-libp2p.git
cd c-libp2p
```

The `--recursive` flag ensures that all third-party submodules are fetched.

### Linux / macOS

```sh
mkdir build
cmake -S . -B build
cmake --build build
ctest --test-dir build
```

Sanitizers can be enabled with `-DENABLE_SANITIZERS=ON` and additional flags in `SANITIZERS`.  Stress tests for the TCP module are built when `-DENABLE_STRESS_TESTS=ON` is passed.

### Windows

A recent Visual Studio with CMake support is recommended.  From the *x64 Native Tools* command prompt run:

```bat
mkdir build
cmake -S . -B build -G "Visual Studio 16 2019" -A x64
cmake --build build --config Release
ctest --test-dir build -C Release
```

When building shared libraries on Windows the produced DLLs are copied next to the test executables automatically.
